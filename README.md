# MedMinder-Medicine-Reminder-MSD3_2-
This is my 3rd year 2nd semester's hardware project using Arduino Mega and Proteus. This projectâ€™s main aim is to make a smart medicine box for those users
who regularly take medicines and the prescription of their medicine is very
long as it is hard to remember to patients and also for their care giver.
Also Old age patients suffer from problems of forget to take pills on proper
time which causes certain health issues for patients having permanent diseases like diabetes, blood pressure, breathing problem, heart problems,
cancer diseases etc. Medi-minder which will solve these problems by setting up time
table of prescribed medicines given in prescription. This smart box be
served for some more purposes such as pulse rate measurement, temperature and humidity measurement of room. The environmental control is
very important for a patient. So, he/she needs to know that. A patient
also needs to know his/her pulse rate. Pulse rate indicates the strength
of the pulse. Medi-minder will serve these purposes for patients to
ensure healthy life.
